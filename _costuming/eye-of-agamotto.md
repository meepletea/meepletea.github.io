excerpt: 3D Printed in Summer 2018
---

This project was completed during the summer of 2018 during heavy con crunch.
Prior to DragonCon, my motivation was waning because of all the incomplete
projects still in the works, so I wanted something relatively simple and quick
just to get a sense of accomplishment.

This was prior to my owning my own 3D printer, so it was done in the print lab
at my office. The print was split between a Lulzbot TAZ6 and MINI2 and all in PLA in
whatever colors were available. I find that by the time I'm done putting on a
few layers of filler primer, the original color it was printed in has very
little effect. That said, these days I do tend to print costume parts in neutral
colors.

After printing and priming, it was a one day paint job. Overall, I'm happy with the result
and would like to go back and make a full Dr. Strange costume some day.
