This was a project done during the summer of 2018 during heavy con crunch.
Prior to DragonCon, my motivation was waning because of all the incomplete
projects still in the works, so I wanted something relatively simple and quick
just to get a sense of accomplishment.

This was prior to my owning my own 3D printer, so it was done at the print lab
at work. The print was split between a Lulzbot TAZ6 and MINI2 and all in PLA in
whatever colors were available. I find that by the time I'm done putting on a
few layers of filler primer, the original color it was printed in has very
little effect. That said, these days I do tend to print costume parts in neutral
colors.

After printing and priming, it was a one day paint job. Overall, I'm happy with the result
and would like to go back and make a full Dr. Strange costume some day.
