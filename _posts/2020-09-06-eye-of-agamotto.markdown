This was a project done during the summer of 2018 during heavy con crunch.
My motivation was waning because of all the incomplete projects still in the
works. 

This was prior to my owning my own 3D printer, so it was done at the print lab
at work. The print was split between a Lulzbot TAZ6 and MINI2 and all in PLA.

After printing, it was a one day paint job. Overall, I'm happy with the result
and would like to go back and make a full Dr. Strange costume some day.
